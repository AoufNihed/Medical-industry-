Our project aims to revolutionize healthcare delivery for factory workers. We are developing a comprehensive health monitoring system that will allow workers to easily register, schedule doctor visits, and receive real-time medical advice through a user-friendly chat interface. The system will also include an intelligent diagnostic system to assess workers' health and recommend necessary medical visits. By providing quick access to medical assistance and promoting early detection and prevention of health issues, our project aims to create safer and healthier work environments for factory workers.
